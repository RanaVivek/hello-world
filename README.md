my name is vivek rana . I am student member of iai. i have cleared 4 papers from iai in three diets. i am also studying for CA final from icai. 
despite being from a non maaths background, i did not struggle to study and clear actuarial exams. that is because i have an interest in technical stuff. i did not take any tutions or something for actuarial exams. i relied just on self study because i believe that doing self study makes you a good problem solver.
